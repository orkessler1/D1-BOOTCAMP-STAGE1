suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 1 is missing.
- Exercise 2, question 3 is not implemented correctly. The `DISTINCT` keyword is required to remove duplicates.

- Exercise 2, question 5 is not implemented correctly. It should be ascending order according to their rental rate
- Exercise 2, question 6 is not implemented at all.
- Exercise 2, question 8 is not implemented correctly. It should check if your favorite movie exists in the database
- Exercise 2, question 10 is not implemented correctly. The `ORDER BY` clause should use `ASC` to find the cheapest movies.
- Exercise 2, question 13 and 14 are missing.
- Exercise 2, question 11 and 15 are bonus and are missing.
