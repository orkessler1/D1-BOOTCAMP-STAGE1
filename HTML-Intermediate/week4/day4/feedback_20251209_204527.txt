suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is completely unrelated to the chapter content, which focuses on Promises and their specific methods (resolve, reject, then, catch) and basic Promise creation and handling.
- The code demonstrates synchronous and asynchronous operations related to burger creation but does not directly address the promise exercises outlined in the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code does not directly address the exercises outlined in the instructions. It includes several promise-related snippets that are not specifically tailored to solve exercises 1, 2, and 3.
- The code needs to be structured to specifically address each exercise's requirements. For example, a function called `compareToTen(num)` that returns a promise based on the number being less or more than 10.
- For Exercise 2, the code should create a promise that resolves after 4 seconds with the string 'success'.
- For Exercise 3, `Promise.resolve(3)` and `Promise.reject('Boo!')` should be used and their results potentially logged or otherwise demonstrated.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the resolve and reject conditions are flipped. Resolve should be used when num <= 10 and reject when num > 10.
- In Exercise 1, you can log the `error` and the `result` directly. You dont need to add the string ${num}.
- You could add a catch block to the success promise to handle any potential errors, although it's not explicitly asked for.
