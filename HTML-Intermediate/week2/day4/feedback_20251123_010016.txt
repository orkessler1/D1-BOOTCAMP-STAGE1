Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses all aspects of both exercises as outlined in the chapter content. It correctly implements file handling, random sentence generation, JSON parsing and modification, and saves the modified JSON to a file. The code follows all instructions precisely.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and uses clear, descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand. The use of comments also helps to explain the purpose of each function and step.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the given tasks. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks. Reading the entire file into memory in `get_words_from_file` might be a concern for extremely large files, but it's acceptable for this exercise.
- security: The code does not involve any user-provided data that could lead to security vulnerabilities. File handling is done safely using `with open()`, which ensures proper file closing.
