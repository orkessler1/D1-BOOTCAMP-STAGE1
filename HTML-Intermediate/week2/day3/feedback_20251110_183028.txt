suggestions for improvement:
- In the Currency class, consider returning a new Currency object in the __add__ method to better represent the result of currency addition, instead of just returning the sum of amounts.
- For consistency, consider using f-strings in all string formatting operations.
- In the random string generator, using `random.choices(letters, k=5)` can be more efficient and readable than a loop.
- When calculating the time difference to January 1st, make the year dynamic so that it always calculates the time to the next January 1st, regardless of the current year.
