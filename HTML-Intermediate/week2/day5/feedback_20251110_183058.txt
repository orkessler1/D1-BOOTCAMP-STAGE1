suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the `is_anagram` method as described in Step 3 of the instructions.
- Implement the `get_anagrams` method as described in Step 4 of the instructions.
- Ensure that the wordlist file is loaded relative to the script's location and that any potential `FileNotFoundError` is handled.
- Consider making the wordlist loading more robust by handling different file encodings.

suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted content is just a list of words, not a Python program implementing the AnagramChecker class and the user interface as described in the problem description.  It doesn't address the OOP, file I/O, string manipulation, or algorithm design aspects outlined in the instructions.
