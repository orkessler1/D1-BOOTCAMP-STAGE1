suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, include your predictions as comments in the code for better clarity and to fulfill the exercise's instructions completely. Also, answer what would happen if `let` was `const`.
- For Exercise 7, ensure that the HTML file includes a navbar with the ID 'navbar' for the JavaScript code to function correctly. The code currently assumes its existence, which might lead to errors if the HTML structure is missing.
- While the code in Exercise 8 correctly implements nested functions and array manipulation, consider adding input validation or error handling to ensure the `makeJuice` function receives a valid size argument. This could prevent unexpected behavior if an invalid size is passed.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only addresses a portion of Exercise 6 and is incomplete and contains errors.
- The self-invoking function is not correctly implemented.
- The string concatenation is incorrect, using template literals improperly.
- The function is not self-invoking as required by the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider consistently using either `console.log` or DOM manipulation for output. Mixing them can make the code harder to understand at a glance.
- For the DOM manipulation example, consider adding a class or ID to the `<p>` element for easier styling or manipulation later.

suggestions for improvement:
- This HTML file provides a basic structure but lacks the JavaScript code that would address the specific exercises outlined in the chapter content. You need to add the JavaScript code that implements the exercises.
