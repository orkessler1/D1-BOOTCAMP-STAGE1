suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code appears to be an attempt at exercise 6. The self-invoking function is not properly structured. It's defined but not immediately invoked, which is the defining characteristic of a self-invoking function. Also, there are syntax errors in the string concatenation. The goal of the exercise is to display the sentence in the DOM, but this part is not complete because the function is not invoked.
- To make the function self-invoking, wrap the function definition in parentheses and immediately follow it with another set of parentheses containing the arguments.
- Correct the string concatenation using template literals properly.
