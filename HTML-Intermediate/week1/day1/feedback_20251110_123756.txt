suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 3, you need to add comments predicting the output before running the code.
- In Exercise 4, consider validating user input to ensure it's a valid computer brand.
- For exercise 2, consider using the exponent operator ** for clarity and efficiency.
- Always sanitize user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, especially when using `input()`.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code addresses all exercises and provides correct solutions for most of them. Exercise 3 is missing the prediction comments, reducing the overall correctness score. The other exercises are correctly implemented as described in the chapter content.
- readability: The code is mostly readable with appropriate variable names and comments. However, adding comments to predict the output of Exercise 3 would improve readability.
- performance: The code is performant for the given tasks. Using more efficient exponentiation could improve performance in Exercise 2, though the impact is negligible for such small numbers.
- security: User inputs are used directly in `print` statements which can lead to code injection if not properly sanitized. Always validate user input or use parameterized queries to prevent such attacks. This affects the security score negatively.
